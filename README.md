Forked from https://github.com/michal-repo/web_vr_video_player

## Demo
[on Github Pages](https://michal-repo.github.io/web_vr_video_player/)

## Requirements

- Web server configured for https (WebXR requires https)
- Python 3
- (optional) FFMPEG, to generate thumbnails

## Setup

### Using JSON solution and provided Python scripts

- Copy `config.ini.example` to `config.ini`
- Edit `config.ini`
- Edit `config.ini` providing correct paths
    All those paths need to be accessible on the same partition. You can use symlink to help that if needed.

(needs reimplementation) Script can set screen type based on file name. Add one of following at the end of file name: `_TB` (Top-Bottom), `_SCREEN`. Default screen type is Side-by-Side.

Supported tags:

- `_SCREEN` - normal 2D screen
- `_SBS` - Side by Side
- `_TB` - Top Bottom 180
- `_360` - Top Bottom 360
- `_2D_180` - fisheye 180, not VR (one lens)
- `_2D_360` - fisheye 360, not VR (one lens)

### Extensions

[Extensions](https://github.com/michal-repo/web_vr_video_player_extensions)

## Generating your own JSON file with video sources

Player is using locally stored "files.json" with video sources.  
To use the included generation script, Configure `config.ini`, then generate with `generate_json.sh`.  
The files generation script will auto generate categories based on the directories the videos are in.

## Generating thumbnails
Configure `config.ini`, then generate with `generate_thumbnails.sh`.   
ffmpeg & ffprobe need to be in path.
 
### Structure for JSON file

        },
        ....
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If videos or player can't be loaded make sure that this app files are owned by web server user (eg. www-data) and that web server user can read video and thumbnail files (eg. www-data is owner or permissions for others include read).
